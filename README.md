## Requirements

-   Storybook@>=6.0.0
-   [Anima Account](https://www.animaapp.com/figma)
-   [Anima's Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/857346721138427857/Export-to-React%2C-HTML-%26-Vue-code-with-Anima)

This addon should work with any framework. If you find a case that the addon does not work, please open an issue.

## Getting started

### 1. Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev storybook-anima
# yarn add -D storybook-anima
```

### 2. Register the addon in `.storybook/main.js`

```js
// .storybook/main.js
module.exports = {
    addons: ["storybook-anima"],
};
```
### 3. Set Anima access token

First get the access token from the Anima Figma plugin, or in your Anima team settings. Learn more about [how to get the token from Anima](https://animaapp.com).

You can then set the access token as an environment variable called `STORYBOOK_ANIMA_TOKEN`.

You can create `.env` file in your project's root folder, or you can provide the environment variable as a command line parameter when building or dynamically running Storybook.


```shell
# .env
STORYBOOK_ANIMA_TOKEN="<paste your TOKEN here>"
```

## Considerations

For the time being, this integration works best if the your stories composition consists of just the component itself, rather than complex stories with multiple examples or included documentation. 

#### In short, what you see in the Storybook story, is what you'll get in Figma.


## Development

Run following commands in separate tabs to start development

```shell
npm run build
npm run dev
```
