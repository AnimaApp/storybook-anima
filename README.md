## Requirements

- Storybook@>=6.0.0
- [Anima Account](https://www.animaapp.com/figma)
- Sign up for [Anima's beta](https://form.typeform.com/to/eNOueDoh)
- [Anima's Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/857346721138427857/Export-to-React%2C-HTML-%26-Vue-code-with-Anima)

This addon should work with any framework. If you find a case that the addon does not work, please open an issue.

## Getting started

### 1. Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev storybook-anima --legacy-peer-deps
# yarn add -D storybook-anima
```

### 2. Register the addon in `.storybook/main.js`

```js
// .storybook/main.js
module.exports = {
  addons: ["storybook-anima"],
};
```

### 3. Set Anima access token

First get the access token from the Anima Figma plugin, or in your Anima team settings. Learn more about [how to get the token from Anima](https://www.loom.com/share/9f93c49c33824773afdb0fc4658c69e0?utm_source=github).

You can then set the access token as an environment variable called `STORYBOOK_ANIMA_TOKEN`.

You can create `.env` file in your project's root folder, or you can provide the environment variable as a command line parameter when building or dynamically running Storybook.

```shell
# .env
STORYBOOK_ANIMA_TOKEN="<paste your TOKEN here>"
```

## Considerations

For the time being, this integration works best if the your stories composition consists of just the component itself, rather than complex stories with multiple examples or included documentation.

#### In short, what you see in the Storybook story, is what you'll get in Figma.

## Limits on the number of variants

The addon currently limits the number of variants to a maximum of 1025 for any given story.
As a result, some props might be missing in the exported
components.

In the near future, we are going to provide some options to
customize which controls should be included or excluded during
the export process.

## Development

Run following commands in separate tabs to start development

```shell
npm run build
npm run dev
```
